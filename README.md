I'm highly motivated student of computer science, I'm allways opened for studing and learning new things.
I'd like to be a part of team, because I'd be able to learn form more experienced people, and gain more experience. 

Since October 2019 I am part of Board of European Students of Technology (BEST) in KoÅ¡ice, in October 2020 I have been promoted to the position of Secretary in Board of our Local BEST group.

Also big fun of The Lord of the Rings and The Witcher (I am kind of fantasy lover)
